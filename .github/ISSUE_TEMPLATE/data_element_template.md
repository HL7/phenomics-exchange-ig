Please use this template to propose a new data element that should be addressed in our IG.  You do not need to understand how to represent it in FHIR. However, it will be very helpful if you provide a short definition (from your point of view) and at least one hypothetical example of the data element. Ideally, the example would be formatted in a structured way (a filed and its value) but it will also help if you use the data element in a full natural language sentence/paragraph as it would be stated between experts in your domain and use case. Phrasing data elements in a full natural language statement frequently clarifies the element, reveals many other elements, and gives an over all context for the element you are proposing.  It will also help if you can describe a workflow or a dataflow where this element would exist, the users that will create and use this element, and if there are any other date elements that are closely related to this element
