# Examples

This page offers links to examples for each of the elements of the Phenopacket.


## Extended example

The following example simulates the situation in which a child presents with developmental delay, microphthalmia, and muscle weakness. The goal
is to identify the etiological (genetic) diagnosis. The phenotypic features that can be used to support the differential diagnosis, potentially in combination with genome sequencing.
The example is based on [Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies), type A, 4](https://omim.org/entry/253800).
