# Deep phenotyping


The word phenotype is used with many different meanings. In biology, the most widely accepted definition of phenotype is <cite>the observable traits of an organism</cite>. In medical contexts, however, the word <cite>phenotype</cite> is more often used to refer to some deviation from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior. 

## Phenotype in biology and medicine

In medical contexts, the word <cite>phenotype</cite> is used to refer to some deviation from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior. The analysis of phenotype plays a key role in clinical practice and medical research, and yet phenotypic descriptions in clinical notes and medical publications are often imprecise. Diseases can be defined by many things including
their etiology, response to treatment, and by the set of phenotypic features that tend to occur in the disease. For instance, patients with the common cold tend to have the phenotypic features of <cite>fever</cite>, <cite>headachce</cite>, <cite>runny nose</cite>, and <cite>malaise</cite>. The word phenotype is used to denote different things in medical contexts, including phenotypic features, traits, or disease entities. 

## Deep phenotyping

Deep phenotyping can be defined as the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described, generally in such a way as to be computationally accessible. Deep 
phenotyping has become a standard approach for computational support of the differential diagnostic process in rare disease, where algorithms typically take sets of [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/) (HPO) terms corresponding to the
signs, symptoms, and laboratory and imaging abnormalities observed in a patient and compare them to computational models of disease using a number of different algorithms (reviewed in [K&ouml;hler et al, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33264411/)).
