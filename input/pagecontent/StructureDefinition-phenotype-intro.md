# Phenotype Observation profile

This profile defines the representation of an individual's phenotypes. A phenotype can be any characteristic of an individual. However, the more common use in clinical and research settings is the description of abnormal physical findings that are usually related to an underlying genotype. 

This profiles allows for indicating the presence or absence of a phenotype. Observation components are used to capture additional aspects of the phenotype.

No vocabulary bindings have been defined yet and might intentionally not be defined in this IG. Other use case specific IGs that extend this IG can define their preferred bindings. The [Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)](https://hpo.jax.org/) is an ontology that provides a wide range of phenotypes supporting rare and undiagnosed diseases and it includes additional knowledge base linkages to support various bioinformatics tools and workflows.
