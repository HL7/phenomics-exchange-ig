# Phenomics Exchange for Research and Diagnostics FHIR R4 Implementation Guide

This implementation guide addresses the need for a structured, granular, and extensible representation of an individual's phenotypes. Such information is critical for use cases such as rare and undiagnosed diseases, and precision medicine. However, it is frequently lacking in EHRs or is represented in a difficult to access form such as PDFs, free text, or brief and non standard entries in order forms.

The IG also addresses the need for exchanging this information between the clinical and research domains, and to facilitate the integration of structured data in existing research data models and bioinformatics tools 

The IG is still in an exploratory phase and is being balloted at comment-level ballot. The goal is to obtain feedback and form a community to prepare for a future STU publication.  This IG, given that it is a comment level ballot, will not be published during this ballot cycle.
