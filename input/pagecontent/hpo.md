# Human Phenotype Ontology

The [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/) (HPO)   was launched in 2008 to provide a comprehensive logical standard to describe and computationally analyze phenotypic abnormalities found in human disease. The HPO is now a worldwide standard for phenotype exchange. As an ontology, HPO enables computational inference and sophisticated algorithms that 
support combined genomic and phenotypic analyses. Broad clinical, translational and research applications using the HPO include genomic 
interpretation for diagnostics, gene-disease discovery, mechanism discovery and cohort analytics, all of which assist in realizing precision 
medicine. 




## Pyrophen

[Pyrophen](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/pyrophen) generates a FHIR Code system representing the Human Phenotype Ontology.  Please see the
[documentation](https://pyrophen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details. The code system can be used by the current IG.
