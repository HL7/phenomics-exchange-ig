# Karyotypic Sex code system

In humans, sex is determined by a system based on X and Y chromosomes. Commonly males have one X and one Y chromosome (46,XY)
and females have two X chromosomes (46,XX). Sex chromosome aneuploidies represent a relatively common 
phenomenon characterized by the loss or gain of one or more sex chromosomes. The five most common
sex chromosome aneuploidies are Turner syndrome (XO), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), trisomy X (XXX), 
XYY, and XXYY. In some cases individuals may have phenotypic sex that differs from that which is
most commonly observed with a given karyotype. For instances, certain variants in SRY can be observed
in phenotypic males with a 46,XX karyotype. In cases such as this, the Phenopacket would code the
phenotypic sex using the ``sex`` attribute (male, in this example), and the karyotypic sex using this
element (XX, in this example).
