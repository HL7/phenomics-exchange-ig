# HPO CodeSystem

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a standardized, controlled vocabulary that 
contains phenotypic information about human disease. The HPO contains over 15,000 
terms describing phenotypic features. The HPO is structured into a directed acyclic 
graph (DAG) in which the terms represent subclasses of their parent term and each 
term in the HPO describes a distinct phenotypic abnormality. The HPO project
additionally provide computational disease models for nearly 8000 Mendelian diseases.
The models specify the clinical manifestations of the diseases using HPO terms
and in many cases additional modifiers that describe the age of onset, the
overall frequency of a phenotypic abnormality in the disease, and other
characteristics. Numerous algorithms have been developed that leverage
this information to implement database searches to support clinical diagnostics.
